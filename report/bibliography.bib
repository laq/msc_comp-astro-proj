abstract = {Special high-accuracy direct force summation N-body algorithms and their relevance for the simulation of the dynamical evolution of star clusters and other gravitating N-body systems in astrophysics are presented, explained and compared with other methods. Other methods means here approximate physical models based on the Fokker–Planck equation as well as other, approximate algorithms to compute the gravitational potential in N-body systems. Questions regarding the parallel implementation of direct “brute force” N-body codes are discussed. The astrophysical application of the models to the theory of relaxing rotating and non-rotating collisional star clusters is presented, briefly mentioning the questions of the validity of the Fokker–Planck approximation, the existence of gravothermal oscillations and of rotation and primordial binaries.}
