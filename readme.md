# Focus project Astrophyicis

Plans for 2 slide presentation:

1st slide purpose of problem:
* Simple one line description
* Plot with max number of stars for 1 or 3 steps?
    * Do memory and time restricted test
    * include different algos for acceleration
    * Including leapfrog?
    * include their energy function??

2nd slide
* use best algorithm to do taichi live simulation
* implement buttons to change the rotation speed of camera





---
Steps:
* Import Leapfrog scheme
* Do animation with Leapfrog scheme
* Do a test of integration with 3body problem
* Set a plummer model to simulate


Done:
[ ] First test of 2d animation with solve_ivp and 3 body problem
Next:
[ ] Organize code to allow easy testing of different methods
[ ] Add my euler or heun solutions
[ ] Add my simplectic solution

[ ] Externalize solver to python file
[ ] Do poc of plummer model moving
[ ] Do poc of 3d 3body problem



--- Did test with taichi using loops and gpu it is not faster than jax, almost the same as numba even with 32 bits

Question: can I make the taichi implementation loop + vector oriented?

Question 2 how high can I go with jax?



### Email:

About my focus project I am considering working on an N-body gravity simulation.
I am thinking I can start animating a cluster created with the Plummer model using a leapfrog scheme
and work my way towards increasing the number of stars.


I have some ideas of additional steps:
1. Parallelize the heavy computation with Numba or Jax(CPU).
2. Do the animation in 3D.
3. Add a hierarchical method to improve scaling.

I am also curious about using a Lagrangian method to incorporate fluid dynamics, but I wonder if that's too much of a stretch.

I appreciate your feedback on my project idea, and would welcome any pointers on how to approach it effectively. 

Best Regards,
Leonardo Qui√±onez
