# Focus project Astrophyicis

Steps:
* Import Leapfrog scheme
* Do animation with Leapfrog scheme
* Do a test of integration with 3body problem
* Set a plummer model to simulate


Done:
[ ] First test of 2d animation with solve_ivp and 3 body problem
Next:
[ ] Organize code to allow easy testing of different methods
[ ] Add my euler or heun solutions
[ ] Add my simplectic solution

[ ] Externalize solver to python file
[ ] Do poc of plummer model moving
[ ] Do poc of 3d 3body problem

About my focus project I am considering working on an N-body gravity simulation.
I am thinking I can start animating a cluster created with the Plummer model using a leapfrog scheme
and work my way towards increasing the number of stars.


I have some ideas of additional steps:
1. Parallelize the heavy computation with Numba or Jax(CPU).
2. Do the animation in 3D.
3. Add a hierarchical method to improve scaling.

I am also curious about using a Lagrangian method to incorporate fluid dynamics, but I wonder if that's too much of a stretch.

I appreciate your feedback on my project idea, and would welcome any pointers on how to approach it effectively. 

Best Regards,
Leonardo Qui√±onez
